# üöÄ React Interview Guide: From Basics to Advanced üî•

Cracking a React interview doesn‚Äôt require building massive apps. If you‚Äôve worked with components, state, and hooks, you‚Äôre already on the right track!

## üìå Part 1: Easy to Moderate Questions

### üå± Fundamentals & Core Concepts

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is React, and why is it popular?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It‚Äôs popular due to its **component-based architecture, Virtual DOM for efficient rendering, and reusable UI components**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How does the Virtual DOM work?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When changes occur, React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous state (**diffing algorithm**), and then updates only the changed parts in the real DOM (**reconciliation**).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is JSX, and how is it different from HTML?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript files. Unlike HTML, JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions using `{}`.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between functional and class components?
- **Functional Components**: Simple, stateless, and written as JavaScript functions.
- **Class Components**: Stateful, require `this` keyword, and use lifecycle methods.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are props and state, and how do they differ?
- **Props**: Passed from parent to child, immutable, used for component communication.
- **State**: Managed within a component, mutable, used for dynamic updates.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ How do you create and use a simple React component?
```jsx
const Hello = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
export default Hello;
```

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is event handling in React?
React handles events similar to JavaScript but uses **camelCase** for event names (e.g., `onClick`). Example:
```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>Click Me</button>
```

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the significance of the `key` prop in lists?
Keys help React **identify which items have changed** in a list, improving performance.
```jsx
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is conditional rendering, and how do you implement it?
Conditional rendering allows displaying UI elements based on conditions.
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
```

#### üîü What are default props, and when are they useful?
Default props provide fallback values if a prop is not passed.
```jsx
const Greeting = ({ name = "Guest" }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

### ‚ö° React Hooks & Component Behavior

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What are React Hooks, and why were they introduced?
Hooks allow using state and lifecycle features in functional components without needing class components.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Explain `useState` and `useEffect` with examples.
```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => { console.log("Component Mounted"); }, []);
```

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
- **Controlled Components**: Managed by React state (`useState`).
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Use `ref` to access values directly from the DOM.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?
Prop drilling occurs when props are passed through multiple components. It can be avoided using **Context API** or **Redux**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ What is React.memo, and how does it help with performance?
`React.memo` prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the component.
```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?
- `useMemo`: Caches values.
- `useCallback`: Caches functions.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What is React Router, and how does client-side navigation work?
React Router enables **navigation without full-page reloads**.
```jsx
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
```

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ What is Context API, and when should it be used over Redux?
Context API is a **lightweight state management solution** useful for **small to medium apps**. Redux is better for **large-scale applications**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs), and how do they work?
HOCs are functions that wrap components to **enhance functionality**.
```jsx
const withLogging = Component => props => {
  console.log("Rendered");
  return <Component {...props} />;
};
```

## üìå Part 2: Moderate to Difficult Questions

### üî• Performance & Optimization

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ How does React handle re-renders, and how can you prevent unnecessary renders?
React re-renders components when **state or props change**. Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary renders.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is reconciliation in React?
Reconciliation is the **process React uses to update the DOM efficiently** by comparing Virtual DOM snapshots.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Explain React‚Äôs diffing algorithm and why it‚Äôs important.
React‚Äôs diffing algorithm **compares previous and current Virtual DOM** trees to update only the changed elements, improving performance.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is React.lazy and Suspense, and how do they enable lazy loading?
Lazy loading **splits code** and loads components only when needed.
```jsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ How do error boundaries work, and why are they useful?
Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in components and prevent the entire app from crashing.
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.log(error, info);
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle authentication and protected routes in React?
Protected routes require authentication before rendering components.
```jsx
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, isAuthenticated }) =>
  isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What are render props, and how do they compare to HOCs?
Render props allow passing functions as props to control rendering behavior.
```jsx
const RenderPropComponent = ({ render }) => render();
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced React & Server-Side Features

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between SSR and CSR?
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Renders HTML on the server.
- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**: Renders in the browser using JavaScript.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ What is React Fiber, and how does it improve rendering?
React Fiber is the **new reconciliation algorithm** that improves rendering performance with **incremental rendering and prioritization**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ What is Concurrent Mode, and how does it enhance performance?
Concurrent Mode improves responsiveness by **pausing, resuming, and prioritizing rendering tasks**.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ How do you test React components? What are the most common testing libraries?
- **Jest**: Unit testing.
- **React Testing Library**: UI testing.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing.
